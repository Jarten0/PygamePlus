# Pygame-Plus
Lightweight Unity-like framework for building small scale games in Python

This has been a small project to test my coding skills in Python and to see what I can do
Ofcourse, a lot of low level user interaction stuff is hard to code, so this framework uses Pygame for displaying images to the screen, obtaining input, and a few small other things.
Everything else has been programmed by me.

# Installation
You need to have Python 3.11+
The first time setup will install Pygame after you make sure you have Python.

# How it works
This framework is heavily inspired by the Unity game engines design, so previous experience can help
This framework can also be useful for getting a grasp on some of the fundamentals of Unity if you want
it the other way around

Everything is divided into two main roles: Objects and Components
An object is essentially a store of components 

# Running the code
Simply run main.py to run your game.

# Other stuff
I regularly release small updates in the dev branch on github, and save some of the more significant releases for the main branch. And DM me on discord (Jarten#4513) if you have anything to comment about this project.
